    <h1 id="#about">About K-Culture</h1>
            <p>
                K-Culture is a short-historied term referring to South Korean popular culture.
                
                The feverish fondness that Korean pop culture attracted in overseas media soon gave rise to a host of terms such terms as the “Korean Wave” (a.k.a. Hallyu), K-Culture, and so on. In fact, the term K-Culture was quickly reimported back into South Korea, where it has been used readily to describe South Korean pop culture.
                
                What is the secret to the ongoing popularity of K-Culture, though? Part of the reason for its success may be found in relation to the institutional, financial and policy support the South Korean government has provided for the movement, continuously and relentlessly working to keep the Korean Wave going and stopping it from becoming a transient phenomenon, all in the hope of enhancing the nation’s soft power.

                TWICE
                - Girl Group
                - 7 members
                
                Twice (Korean: 트와이스) is a South Korean girl group. The group was created through the reality show Sixteen. There are nine members in the group. They are Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Momo, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun, Chaeyoung and Tzuyu.
                
                Twice is the first female Korean act to simultaneously top both Billboard's World Albums and World Digital Song Sales charts with the release of their first studio album Twicetagram and its lead single "Likey" in 2017. After signing with Republic Records for American promotions as part of a partnership with JYP Entertainment, the group achieved five top-ten albums on the US Billboard 200 and topped the chart in 2024 with their thirteenth extended play With You-th. Their first official English-language single, "The Feels" (2021), became their first song to enter the US Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart, peaking at the 83rd and 80th positions of the charts, respectively. Their point choreography—including for "Cheer Up" (2016), "TT" (2016), "Signal" (2017), and "What Is Love?" (2018)—became dance crazes and viral memes imitated by many celebrities.

                These shows began to be produced around the early 1960s, but were mostly consumed domestically until the rise of the Korean Wave in the 1990s. They have since achieved significant international popularity, with millions of viewers across the world.

                Korean Fashion is a blend of both traditional prints and colors mixed with modern fashion. Their sense of style is conservative and fun but still practical.
                
                Oversized silhouettes are not a new trend in Korea, in fact, Koreans enjoy wearing anything oversized in every season but this year, they are one of the key trends in Korean street style for Spring 2024.
