        <h1>About K-Culture</h1>
        <p>
            K-Culture is more than just a genre; it's a global phenomenon. It is a short-historied term referring to South Korean popular culture.
                
                The feverish fondness that Korean pop culture attracted in overseas media soon gave rise to a host of terms such terms as the “Korean Wave” (a.k.a. Hallyu), K-Culture, and so on. In fact, the term K-Culture was quickly reimported back into South Korea, where it has been used readily to describe South Korean pop culture.

        <p>
            What is the secret to the ongoing popularity of K-Culture, though? Part of the reason for its success may be found in relation to the institutional, financial and policy support the South Korean government has provided for the movement, continuously and relentlessly working to keep the Korean Wave going and stopping it from becoming a transient phenomenon, all in the hope of enhancing the nation’s soft power.
